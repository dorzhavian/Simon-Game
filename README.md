# Simon Game

In progress at udemy course of "Web Development Bootcamp" I created a the simon game using JS.
Simon game is a rhythmic electronic game . designed to develop memory. 
The goal of the game is to repeat by clicking on the randomly selected colors in the same order as they were done and to remember who was and how many times.
